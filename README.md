# ARM SVC Call
This repo contains a Demo header and assembly file for an ARM Cortex SVC Call mechanism.

It was designed to replace the old Keil uVision SVC Call mechanism which is not present in the current ARM compiler, nor in GCC or Clang, so as to port a Demo RTOS developed by Andy Pomfrett at York for teaching to the new toolchain, but will work with any software on an ARM Cortex.
